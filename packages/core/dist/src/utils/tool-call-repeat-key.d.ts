 * Stable identity of a (tool, args) call for repeat tracking: a sha256 over
 * the canonicalized name and args (legacy aliases resolved, sorted object
 * keys, preserved array order), so identical calls that differ only in
 * field order — or in a legacy alias such as `task` vs `agent` — hash to
 * the same key, and large payloads (e.g. write_file content) are retained
 * as a fixed-size digest rather than the raw JSON. Shared by the loop
 * detection service, the daemon's turn-loop guard (ACP Session), and the
 * duplicate provider tool-call replay detection so every runtime keys
 * repeats the same way.
