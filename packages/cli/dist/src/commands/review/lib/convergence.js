// Is this review loop converging, and if not, why?
//
// A push-triggered review plus an agent addressing its findings is a feedback
// loop, and the loop's gain can exceed 1: every accepted fix widens the diff,
// the next round reviews more code, and more findings come back. Measured on
// this repository, PRs have carried hundreds of open threads and still not
// settled — one closed unmerged at ~500.
//
// The damper the pipeline already has is the round-adaptive posting floor, but
// nothing tells the humans WHY a particular loop is not settling. This module
// answers that from facts the round already holds, and it answers only that:
// it states what it measured and what the shapes usually mean, and it makes no
// decision. Whether to keep fixing, restructure, split or land is the author's
// and the operator's call — the skill holds advisory power, never decision
// power, so nothing here withholds a finding, caps a verdict, or changes what
// the round posts.
//
// Every trigger is a comparison between THIS pull request's own rounds. There
// is no threshold, no "too many comments" number: a volume bar is somebody's
// policy, and a policy the tool owns is a policy the tool would have to defend
// on repositories it knows nothing about. A PR diverging at 40 comments
// deserves the reading that a threshold of 100 would have delayed, and a large
// review whose findings are shrinking deserves no interruption at all.

 *   carries a NEW one now. Joined by FILE, deterministically — no model
 *   judgement, no similarity scoring. Title similarity was considered and
 *   dropped: the titles are model-written and capped at 80 characters, which
 *   makes them noise at exactly the length where a match would matter. A
 *   cluster that keeps regenerating siblings usually means the fixes are
 *   treating instances of a shared root cause, and that sentence is the whole
 *   value here.
 * - **Volume not shrinking.** From round 3, this round producing at least as
 *   many NEW findings as the previous one. Round 3 because two rounds give
 *   one step and a step is not a trend; "not shrinking" rather than
 *   "growing" because a loop holding steady is not converging either; and
 *   NEW findings rather than the comment total because Step 6 re-posts every
 *   unfixed entry, so the total only ever rises.
 *
 * Both signals read FRESH drafts only. A re-posted still-standing finding is
 * the loop holding its position, not the loop generating work, and counting
 * it as activity fires both signals on the calmest shape there is (see
 * `DraftedFinding`).
 *
 * Returns null — not an empty diagnosis — when neither fires, so a caller
 * cannot accidentally render a section that says nothing. Absent inputs make
 * a signal impossible to evaluate rather than true: a round with no recovered
 * predecessor has no volume to compare against, and one with no previous work
 * list has no recurrence to find.
